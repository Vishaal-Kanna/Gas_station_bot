#Gas Sation Fuel Arm

Refuelling vehicles in a gas station is simulated and demonstrated by solving the inverse kinematics for a manipulator with 6 revolute joints for the arm and two for the end effector. The project was part of the academic coursework ENPM662-Introduction to Robot Modeling at the Univeristy of Maryland-College Park.
